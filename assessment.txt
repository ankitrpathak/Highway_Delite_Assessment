or through their Google account. Ensure that all inputs required for
signup are properly validated.
2. Display relevant error messages in case of incorrect inputs, OTP errors,
or API failures.
3. After signup or login, display a welcome page and show user
information. Also, provide the user with the ability to create and
delete notes.
4. The user should also be able to log in using their Google account. (if
signed up using their google account otherwise login using google
account not necessary).
5. Ensure the design is mobile-friendly and closely replicates the
provided design from the link above.
6. Use JWT to authorize the user for creating or deleting their notes.
7. MOST IMPORTANT: Do not do everything at once, start with basic structure first and let me know once it's done so that I can commit it, then move forward with rest of the features one-by-one, I need to commit every feature one by one so do let me know when one feature is done and after confirmation, move to the other features.
